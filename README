Suxtape
_______

A super simplified version of Ruxtape written in Sinatra.



Features:
_________________

There is no Song Model like in Ruxtape. Everything is accomplished via the filesystem directly.
You cannot reorder songs after they've been added, there is no sort column to work with. Just like
it was when creating a real mixed tape, if you screw up your tape you'll have to erase the whole tape and start over.

If you'd like to reorder the songs on the fly I suggest you get one of those new fangled Compact-Disc Players. ;)
