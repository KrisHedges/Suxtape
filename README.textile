h1. Suxtape

A super simplified version of Ruxtape written in Sinatra.

h2. Features:

There is no Song Model like in Ruxtape. Everything is accomplished via the filesystem directly. You cannot reorder songs after they've been added, there is no sort column to work with. Just like it was when creating a real mixed tape, if you screw up your tape you'll have to erase the whole tape and start over.

If you'd like to reorder the songs on the fly I suggest you get one of those new fangled Compact-Disc Players. ;)

h2. Required Gems

ruby-mp3info

h2. Authorization

Authentication is handled by a lib/authorization - simple http authentication. Username and Pass are set in lib/authorization.rb

The Default is 
	_test:test_
